How to approach for this Data Set ?

You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. 
Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report 
sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete 
this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This 
project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.


Conclusion:

All the important findings and insights are reported in the ipynb and html file with codes.
